    BrowserRouter as Router -all routing need components
    Routes                  -to set paths need for each components

 REDUX
........

coupling   : many connection between parent and child component


props drilling : in coupling if any intermediate component have any errors all other childs will not work


to avoid props drilling we need to reduce coupling and make all the components independent


for this react introduced a new technology  - state management technology -REDUX


REDUX process
..............

create a new js file to keep the states ,all the components can access the js file 

- the components can access the datas from the js file 
  but the cant update datas in js file




   
                 (diagram imprt) 








  -Action -> a file where all the logic update the state 

  -Dispatch -> method used to Dispatch the logic in Action file when the component need state updation

  -Reducer (library) -> update the datas in js file according to the paylod response get from Action file
